# Prosigliere Challenge - Blog API

## How to Run

make sure you have .NET 8 installed on your machine

## Next steps

If I had more time, I would try to improve the API documentation, include Logs for monitoring, and add unit tests to ensure quality in functionality, and perhaps a Rate Limiter to avoid overloading of API requests.
